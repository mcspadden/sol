# sol
A martian utility

A sol is the duration of a solar day on Mars, equating to 24 hours, 39 minutes and 35.244 seconds <sup>[1]</sup>. I named this project sol because of my interest in making humans interplanetary, specifically on the Red Planet. A self-sustaining human base on Mars rests in the hands of my generation, not an advanced generation distant from now. It is up to us to seize the opportunity and I created sol to contribute to such.
